This repo provides an implementation of [Narwhal and Tusk](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11827.pdf). The codebase has been designed to be small, efficient, and easy to benchmark and modify. It has not been designed to run in production but uses real cryptography ([dalek](https://doc.dalek.rs/ed25519_dalek)), networking ([tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio)), and storage ([rocksdb](https://docs.rs/rocksdb)).

## Quick Start
The core protocols are written in Rust, but all benchmarking scripts are written in Python and run with [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/).
To deploy and benchmark a testbed of 4 nodes on your local machine, clone the repo and install the python dependencies:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mystenlabs/narwhal.git
$ cd narwhal/benchmark
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You also need to install Clang (required by rocksdb) and [tmux](https://linuxize.com/post/getting-started-with-tmux/#installing-tmux) (which runs all nodes and clients in the background). Finally, run a local benchmark using fabric:
```
$ fab local
```
This command may take a long time the first time you run it (compiling rust code in `release` mode may be slow) and you can customize a number of benchmark parameters in `fabfile.py`. When the benchmark terminates, it displays a summary of the execution similarly to the one below.
```

## Next Steps
The next step is to read the paper [Narwhal and Tusk: A DAG-based Mempool and Efficient BFT Consensus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11827.pdf). It is then recommended to have a look at the README files of the [worker](https://github.com/mystenlabs/narwhal/tree/master/worker) and [primary](https://github.com/mystenlabs/narwhal/tree/master/primary) crates. An additional resource to better understand the Tusk consensus protocol is the paper [All You Need is DAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08325) as it describes a similar protocol. 

The README file of the [benchmark folder](https://github.com/mystenlabs/narwhal/tree/master/benchmark) explains how to benchmark the codebase and read benchmarks' results. It also provides a step-by-step tutorial to run benchmarks on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) accross multiple data centers (WAN).
