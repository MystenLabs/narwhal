The BlockSynchronizer on its own for the certificates that fetches on the fly from peers doesn’t care/deal about any other validation checks than the basic verification offered via the certificate entity it self. For that reason the Handler offers methods to submit the fetched from peers certificates for further validation & processing (e.x ensure parents history is causally complete) to the core and wait until the certificate has been processed, before it returns it back as result."]]};
